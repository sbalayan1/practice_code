// For a string sequence, a string word is k-repeating if word concatenated k times is a substring of sequence. The word's maximum k-repeating value is the highest value k where word is k-repeating in sequence. If word is not a substring of sequence, word's maximum k-repeating value is 0.

//Given strings sequence and word, return the maximum k-repeating value of word in sequence.
// Example 1:

    // Input: sequence = "ababc", word = "ab"
    // Output: 2
    // Explanation: "abab" is a substring in "ababc".

let maxRepeatingSubstring = (str, substr) => {
    let k = 0, concatSubstr = substr
    while (str.includes(concatSubstr)) {
        concatSubstr += substr
        k++
    }
    
    return k
}
